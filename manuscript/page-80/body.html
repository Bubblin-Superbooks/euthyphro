<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>EUTHYPHRO: True.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then either we were wrong in our former assertion; or, if we were right then, we are wrong now.</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: One of the two must be true.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety? That is an enquiry which I shall never be weary of pursuing as far as in me lies; and I entreat you not to scorn me, but to apply your mind to the utmost, and tell me the truth. For, if any man knows, you are he; and therefore I must detain you, like Proteus, until you tell. If you had not certainly known the nature of piety and impiety, I am confident that you would never, on behalf of a serf, have charged your aged father with murder. You would not have run such a risk of doing wrong in the sight of the gods, and you would have had too much respect for the opinions of men. I am sure, therefore, that you know the nature of piety and impiety. Speak out then, my dear Euthyphro, and do not hide your knowledge.</p></div> </div>
