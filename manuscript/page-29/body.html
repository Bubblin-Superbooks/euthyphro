<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: Yes.</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: And who is he?</p><p>SOCRATES: A young man who is little known, Euthyphro; and I hardly know him: his name is Meletus, and he is of the deme of Pitthis. Perhaps you may remember his appearance; he has a beak, and long straight hair, and a beard which is ill grown.</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: No, I do not remember him, Socrates. But what is the charge which he brings against you?</p><p>SOCRATES: What is the charge? Well, a very serious charge, which shows a good deal of character in the young man, and for which he is certainly not to be despised. He says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who are their corruptors. I fancy that he must be a wise man, and seeing that I am the reverse of a wise man, he has found me out, and is going to accuse me of corrupting his young friends. And of this our mother the state is to be the judge.</p></div> </div>
