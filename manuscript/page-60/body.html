<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: I mean to say that the holy has been acknowledged by us to be loved of God because it is holy, not to be holy because it is loved.</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: Yes.</p><p>SOCRATES: But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them because it is loved by them, not loved by them because it is dear to them.</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: True.</p><p>SOCRATES: But, friend Euthyphro, if that which is holy is the same with that which is dear to God, and is loved because it is holy, then that which is dear to God would have been loved as being dear to God; but if that which is dear to God is dear to him because loved by him, then that which is holy would have been holy because loved by him. But now you see that the reverse is the case, and that they are quite different from one another.</p></div> </div>
