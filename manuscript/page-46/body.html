<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>EUTHYPHRO: True.</p><p>SOCRATES: Or suppose that we differ about magnitudes, do we not quickly end the differences by measuring?</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: Very true.</p><p>SOCRATES: And we end a controversy about heavy and light by resorting to a weighing machine?</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: To be sure.</p><p>SOCRATES: But what differences are there which cannot be thus decided, and which therefore make us angry and set us at enmity with one another? I dare say the answer does not occur to you at the moment, and therefore I will suggest that these enmities arise when the matters of difference are the just and unjust, good and evil, honourable and dishonourable. Are not these the points about which men differ, and about which when we are unable satisfactorily to decide our differences, you and I and all of us quarrel, when we do quarrel?
