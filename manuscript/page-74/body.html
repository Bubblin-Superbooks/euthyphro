<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>EUTHYPHRO: Exactly.</p><p>SOCRATES: And of the many and fair things done by the gods, which is the chief or principal one?</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: I have told you already, Socrates, that to learn all these things accurately will be very tiresome. Let me simply say that piety or holiness is learning how to please the gods in word and deed, by prayers and sacrifices. Such piety is the salvation of families and states, just as the impious, which is unpleasing to the gods, is their ruin and destruction.</p><p>SOCRATES: I think that you could have answered in much fewer words the chief question which I asked, Euthyphro, if you had chosen. But I see plainly that you are not disposed to instruct me&mdash;clearly not: else why, when we reached the point, did you turn aside? Had you only answered me I should have truly learned of you by this time the nature of piety.</p></div> </div>
