For I observe that no one appears to notice you&mdash;not even this Meletus; but his sharp eyes have found me out at once, and he has indicted me for impiety. And therefore, I adjure you to tell me the nature of piety and impiety, which you said that you knew so well, and of murder, and of other offences against the gods. What are they? Is not piety in every action always the same? and impiety, again&mdash;is it not always the opposite of piety, and also the same with itself, having, as impiety, one notion which includes whatever is impious?</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: To be sure, Socrates.</p></div> </div>
