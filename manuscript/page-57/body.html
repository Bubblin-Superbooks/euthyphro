<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.</p><p>SOCRATES: Well; and now tell me, is that which is carried in this state of carrying because it is carried, or for some other reason?</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: No; that is the reason.</p><p>SOCRATES: And the same is true of what is led and of what is seen?</p><p>EUTHYPHRO: True.</p><p>SOCRATES: And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but conversely, visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because it is in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the state of being carried, but the converse of this. And now I think, Euthyphro, that my meaning will be intelligible; and my meaning is, that any state of action or passion implies previous action or passion. It does not become because it is becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes; neither does it suffer because it is in a state of suffering, but it is in a state of suffering because it suffers. Do you not agree?</p></div> </div>
